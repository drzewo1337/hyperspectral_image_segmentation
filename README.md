# hyperspectral_image_segmentation
The project investigates hyperspectral imaging for segmentation driven by material-specific spectral signatures. Hyperspectral data comprise hundreds of narrow wavelength bands (e.g., 400–1000 nm). Distinct reflectance profiles enable robust discrimination of materials within a scene.
